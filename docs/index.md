## this is the page for the color-project!

the plan: use the sidebar as a table of contents, where at the top the name of the project, a short description of the project, and a link back to the home page (my portfolio page) is listed. 

at the bottom of all of that, the table of contents is listed wherein each link will point to the part of the article which consists of the topic (the entire project will be one page, separated by headers in which the link in the table of contents will point to the relevant topic).

a proposed table of contents:

### introduction

### examples of music to color

### examples of color to music
  - using machine learning to "melodify" a sequence of musical notes (points to the musical machine learning section)

### analysis of different musical time periods
  - what kinds of "musical" colors did artists in the impressionist era use/which colors represent the songs of the impressionist era?
  - ^^^ with other eras as well
  
### use ML to melodify a sequence of musical notes

### for those who have synthesia (a condition in which one sees color when they hear music - here is an interactive (link to another github project which is the interactive version of the idea behind the current now) can try inputting their own color to music relationship)
